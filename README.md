# mastermind-top

This has been my most complex project to date. Still getting oriented with OOP, but I successfully used inheritence and subclasses to reuse my gameboard logic regardless of which side the user is playing. Created Knuth's algorithm with random guesses to give the player an oponent when selecting a code. Will refactor with better practices as I gain more experience!
